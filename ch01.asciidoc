== Scaffolding

Starting a project new, Bootstrap comes comes with a handful of useful elements to get you started. Normally, when I start a poroject, I start with tools like http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/[Eric Meyer's CSS reset], and get going on my web project. With Bootstrap, you just need to include the CSS file, and optionally the javascript file and you are ready to go. First off, there are few thing that you need to do get started.

=== Bootstrap File Structure

----
 bootstrap/
	├── css/
	│   ├── bootstrap.css
	│   ├── bootstrap.min.css
	├── js/
	│   ├── bootstrap.js
	│   ├── bootstrap.min.js
	├── img/
	│   ├── glyphicons-halflings.png
	│   ├── glyphicons-halflings-white.png
	└── README.md
----

The Bootstrap download includes three folders: css, js, and img. For simplicity, add these to the root of your project. Included are also minified versions of the CSS and Javascript. Both the uncompressed and the minified versions do not need to be included. For the sake of brevity, I use the uncompressed during development, and then switch to the compressed version in production.

=== Basic HTML Template

Normally, a web project looks something like this:

.Basic HTML Layout
[source,html]
-------------
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
	</body>
</html>
-------------

With Bootstrap, we simply include the link to the stylesheet, and the Javascript.

.Basic Bootstrap Template
[source, html]
--------------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
		<title>Bootstrap 101 Template</title>
		<!-- Bootstrap -->
		<link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
	</head>
	<body>
		<h1>Hello, world!</h1>
		<script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
	</body>
</html>
--------------

=== Global Styles

With Bootstrap, a number of the items come prebuilt. Instead of using the old reset block that was part of the Bootstrap 1.0 tree, Bootstrap 2.0 uses http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/[Normalize.css], a project from http://necolas.github.com/normalize.css/[Nicolas Gallagher] that is part of the HTML5 Boilerplate.

Typography and links are given a speacial treatment here. 

* `margin` has been removed from the body
* `background-color: white;` on the body
* Bootrap is using the `@baseFontFamily, @baseFontSize, and @baseLineHeight` attributes as our typographyic base
* Also set the global link color via `@linkColor` and apply link underlines only on :hover

[NOTE]
====
Remember, if you don't like the colors, or want to change a default, this can be done in the scaffolding.less file, or overwritten in the users stylesheet.

=== Default Grid System

The default Bootstrap grid system utilizes 12 columns, making for a 940px wide container without responsive features enabled. With the responsive CSS file added, the grid adapts to be 724px and 1170px wide depending on your viewport. Below 767px viewports, the columns become fluid and stack vertically. At the default width, each column is 60 pixels wide, offset 20 pixels to the left.

==== Basic grid HTML

To create a simple layout, create a '.row', and add the appropriate amount of '.span*' columns. Since we have 12-column grid, we just need to have the amount of '.span*' columns add up to twelve. We could use a 3-6-3 layout, 4-8, 3-5-4, 2-8-2, we could go on and on, but I think you get the gist.


.Basic Grid Layout
[source, html]
--------------

<div class="row">
  <div class="span8">...</div>
  <div class="span4">...</div>
</div>
---------------

In the above example, we have span8, and a span4 adding up to 12.

==== Offsetting Columns

You can move columns to the right using the '.offset*' class. Each class moves the span over that width. So an '.offset4' would move a '.span4' over four columns. 

.Offsetting Columns
[source, html]
------------------
<div class="row">
  <div class="span2">...</div>
  <div class="span7 offset2">...</div>
</div>
------------------
