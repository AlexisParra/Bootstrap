== Base CSS

At the core of Bootstrap are a set of basic HTML elements that have been styled in such a way that allow for easy enhancement via classes and user styles.

=== Typography

Starting with Typography, with the default font stack, Bootstrap has Helvitica Neau, Helvetica, Arial, and sans-serif. All body copy has the `font-size` set at 14 pixels, with the `line-height` set at 20 pixels. The `<p>` tag has a `margin-bottom` of 10 pixels, or half the `line-height`.

==== Headings

<!-- Add headings image here-->

All six headings have been styled in Bootstrap, with the `<h1>` at 36 pixels high, and the `<h6>` down to 12 pixels in height. In addition, to add emphasis to any of the headings, simply add `<small>` around any of the elements, and you will get smaller text, in a lighter color. In the case of the `<h1>`, the small text is 24 pixels tall, normal font weight, and its color is grey.

[code, css]
----------
h1 small {
	font-size:24px;
	font-weight:normal;
	line-height:1;
	color:#999;
	}
----------

===== Lead body copy

To add some emphasis to a paragraph, add `class="lead"`. This will give you larger font size, lighter wieight, and a taller line height.

===== Emphasis

In addition to using the `<small>` tag with headings, like I mentioned above, you can also use it with body copy. When doing so, the font becomes 85% of its original size. 

===== Bold

To add emphasis to text, simply add the `<strong>` tag. This will add the `font-weight-bold` to the text. 

===== Italics

For italics, simply add the `<em>` tag to your content. The root of em, is to add emphasis or stress to your text.

.Heads Up!
NOTE: You might be thinking to yourself, why not just use the `<b>` or `<i>` tags instead of `<em>` or `<strong>`. In HTML5, `<b>` is meant to highlight words or phrases without conveying additional importance while `<i>` is mostyle for voice, technical terms, etc.

===== Empasis classes

With `<strong>` and `<em>`, Boootstrap also offers a few classes that can be used to provide emphasis. 

.Emphasis Classes
[code, html]
--------
<p class="muted">This content is muted</p>
<p class="text-warning">This content carries a warning class</p>
<p class="text-error">This content carries an error class</p>
<p class="text-info">This content carries an info class</p>
<p class="text-success">This content carries a success class</p>
<p>This content has <em>emphasis</em>, and can be <strong>bold</strong></p>
--------

===== Abbreviations

The HTML `<abbr>` element is to provide markup for abbreviations or acronyms, like WWW or HTTP. By amrking up abbreviations, you can give useful information to browsers, spell checkers, translation systems or search engines. Bootstrap styles the `<abbr>` tag adding a light dotted border on the bottom, and adding the full lenth context on cover. 


.Abbreviation Example
[code, html]
--------
<abbr title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>
--------
.Emphasis Classes

Add `.initialism` to an `<abbr>` for a slightly smaller font size.

<abbr title="Real Simple Syndication">RSS</abbr>

===== Addresses

For screen readers, and search engines, adding an `<address>` field to you page can help with the location of physical addresses and phone numbers. It can also be used in the markup of email addresses. Since the `<address>` defaults to `display:block;` all text insde needs to have `<br>` tags if you want line breaks.

--------

  <abbr title="Phone">P:</abbr> (707) 827-7000
</address>

  <a href="mailto:#">flast@oreilly.com</a>

===== Blockquotes

If you are going to be quoting blocks of text in your document, add the `<blockquote>` around the text. For best results, and for line breaks, wrap each section in a `<p>` tag. The default styling involves indenting the text, and adding a thick grey border on the left side. To idenify a source, add the `<small>` tag, with the author inside of a `<cite>` tag. When you put it all together, you get something that looks like this: 

.Blockquote Markup
[code, html]
--------
<blockquote>
	<p>That this is needed, desperately needed, is indicated by the incredible uptake of Bootstrap. I use it in all the server software I'm working on. And it shows through in the templating language I'm developing, so everyone who uses it will find it's "just there" and works, any time you want to do a Bootstrap technique. Nothing to do, no libraries to include. It's as if it were part of the hardware. Same approach that Apple took with the Mac OS in 1984.</p>
	<small>Developer of RSS, <cite title="Source Title">Dave Winer</cite></small>
</blockquote>
--------

.Heads Up!
NOTE: If you would like to have a `<blockquote>` with content that is `right-aligned`, simply add `.pull-right` to the tag. In addition to the right-aligned text, the entire `blockquote` is floated the right. This will create nice pull-quotes in a your content.
