== Using Bootstrap

=== Github Project

Like a lot of great open source projects, the power of Bootstrap comes not just from the developers at the core of the project, but also from the developement community that supports it. (GitHub)[http://github.com] is a large code repository for projects, and at time of writing, Bootstrap is the most popular project. With over 42,000 stars, and over 10,000 forks, the project is bustling with activity. Like I mentioned in chapter 1, if you want to use Bootstrap, you can simply download the .zip archive from the site, or you can download using `git`.

For the unitiated, `git` is a free and open source version control system. Bootstrap, and a host of other projects manage everything using Github, which is an online code repository for `git` projects. To download the source for Bootstrap, run the following commands from the command line.

[source, bash]
----
$ git clone https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap.git
----

Cloning the Rootstrap will give you a full download of all the files, not just the CSS/Javascript but also all of the documentation pages, and the LESS files for the dynamic Javascript elements.

If desired, using the LESS files, you can compile your own version of Bootstrap with the features, or customizations that you desire. 

==== Customizing Bootstrap

You can download the source, or if you want to easily customize a few of the colors, sizing, or plugins, you can cater the Bootstrap to your needs via the [Bootstrap website](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/customize.html).

When you use the customize page, you decide what components you need, you might choose to leave off all of the responsive features, or maybe leave off the button classes if they conflict with styles that you already have. Then you can opt out of any of the jQuery plugins. If you know that you aren't going to be using the modals, or the carousel, you could leave it out of the build so that you a smaller file to request.

Lastly, you have the LESS variables that you can configure. Everything from column count, to typography colors can be modified here. When you have the options included that you can download a customized build of Bootstrap.

==== Using LESS

There are a few different ways to use LESS with Bootstrap. The first, and perhaps the easiest is to use a preprocessor like Codekit, or SimpLess. Using these tools, you can set them up to watch certain files or folders. Then when you save any of those files, they build the master CSS files. In addition to using traditional CSS techiniques, you can use advanced features like mixins and functions to dynamically change the look of your site just by changing some variables.


// Is there a LESS book that O'Reilly publishes?
// I might know someone to write one... Want to include something like the following line:
// This book doesn't mean to be the exclusive look at using LESS, for that checkout #### book by ####, which is a great resource for learning more about LESS.

==== Text Snippets

To rapidly develop Bootstrap sites, I like to use http://www.sublimetext.com/2[Sublime Text 2], and the Bootstrap snippets from https://github.com/devtellect[DEVtellect] on https://github.com/devtellect/sublime-twitter-bootstrap-snippets/[Github]. This makes any componant easy as a keyboard shortcut to add to the page.

There are clippings for lots of popular IDEs/Text Editors.
